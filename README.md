# Coral-Bleaching-Predictor

The LSTM SST Predictor is the LSTM model to predict future SST values. The Simple Global Bleaching Predictor is for predicting the percent of bleaching given certain datapoints and reef conditions. The Global Bleaching Data.csv is the training dataset for the bleaching predictor. The LSTM was trained on time-series data from NOAA at a resoltuion of 1 degree of sea surface temperature data.
